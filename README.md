# pop-upgrade

Utility for upgrading Pop!\_OS and its recovery partition to new releases. This tool will be used
as a replacement for Ubuntu's `do-release-upgrade` script. The goal is to be less error-prone,
ensuring that critical packages are retained on upgrade, and better integration with Pop!\_OS.
